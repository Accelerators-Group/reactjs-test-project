# React github test project - Mit K Patel

## Project goal

+ Create a small project to search and list the repositories.
+ User can add the repositories to the bookmark page.

## Implementation

+ Here I used the TypeScript and ReactJS to build this project. There are two screens in this project. One is Home page and another is bookmark page.
+ User can search the user by providing the username of the GitHub and they can get the list of repositories.
+ User can also see the details of that repositories such as number of fork, star, supported languages and name of the user.
+ There is a seperate bookmark button to add the repository into bookmark page. User can add multiple repos into bookmark page.
+ There is a dedicated button to re-direct to the bookmark page and in bookmark page user can see the list of bookmark repos URL and search among the list.

## Technical

+ To create this app, I made the Header component for the nav bar, and Home component is for Home page.
+ For the details of the selected repo, I created the RepoDetails component.
+ In the bookmark page, I used the filter function of JavaScript to seach the filter repository.
+ To pass the data from Home page to Navigation page, I used the Link component.
